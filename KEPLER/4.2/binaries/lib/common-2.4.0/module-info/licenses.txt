AGREEMENT .

LICENSE TO EVALUATE EA SOFTWARE: The Binary Code License Agreement
("BCL") and the Evaluation Terms ("Evaluation Terms") below shall
apply to the portions of the Software identified as Early Access in
the Software's Release Notes. The BCL and the Evaluation Terms shall
collectively be referred to as the Evaluation Agreement ("Evaluation
Agreement").

LICENSE TO USE FCS SOFTWARE: The BCL and the Supplemental Terms
("Supplemental Terms") provided following the BCL shall apply to
portions of the Software identified as FCS Software in the Software's
Release Notes. BCL and the Supplemental Terms shall collectively be
referred to as the Agreement ("Agreement").


EVALUATION TERMS

The terms of the Evaluation Agreement shall apply to portions of
Software identified as Early Access in the Software's Release Notes
("Software"). These Evaluation Terms add to or modify the terms of the
BCL. Capitalized terms not defined in these Evaluation Terms shall
have the same meanings ascribed to them in the BCL. These Evaluation
Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or conflicting terms in the BCL
below, or in any license contained within the Software.

I. LICENSE TO EVALUATE. Sun grants to you, a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, royalty-free and limited license to use one (1) copy
of the Software internally for the purposes of evaluation only for one
hundred eighty (180) days after the date you download the Software
from Sun ("Evaluation Period"). No license is granted to you for any
other purpose. You may not sell, rent, loan or otherwise encumber or
transfer the Software in whole or in part, to any third party.
Licensee shall have no right to use the Software for productive or
commercial use.

II. DUTIES. You agree to evaluate and test the Software for use in
your software environment and provide feedback to Sun in a manner
reasonably requested by Sun. Any and all test results, error data,
reports or other information, feedback or materials made or provided
by you relating to Software (collectively, "Feedback") is the
exclusive property of Sun and you hereby assigns all Feedback to Sun
at no cost to Sun. Sun may use such Feedback in any manner and for any
purpose, without limitation, liability or obligation to you.

III. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. For purposes of the Evaluation
Agreement, "Confidential Information" means:  (i) business and
technical information and any source code or binary code, which Sun
discloses to Licensee related to Software; (ii) Licensee's feedback
based on Software; and (iii) the terms, conditions, and existence of
this Agreement.  Licensee may not disclose or use Confidential
Information, except for the purposes specified in this Agreement.  You
will protect the Confidential Information with the same degree of
care, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, as Licensee uses
to protect its own Confidential Information. You must restrict access
to Confidential Information to your employees or contractors with a
need for access to perform their employment or contractual obligations
and who have agreed in writing to be bound by a confidentiality
obligation, which incorporates the protections and restrictions
substantially as set forth in this Agreement. Your obligations
regarding Confidential Information will expire no less than five (5)
years from the date of receipt of the Confidential Information, except
for Sun source code which will be protected in perpetuity.  You agree
that Software contains Sun trade secrets. Notwithstanding any
provisions contained in this Agreement concerning nondisclosure and
non-use of the Confidential Information, the nondisclosure obligations
of this section will not apply to any portion of Confidential
Information that you can demonstrate in writing is:  (i) now, or
hereafter through no act or failure to act on the part of you becomes,
generally known to the public; (ii) known to you at the time of
receiving the Confidential Information without an obligation of
confidentiality; (iii) hereafter rightfully furnished to you by a
third party without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) independently
developed by you without any use ofthe Confidential Information.

IV. TERMINATION AND/OR EXPIRATION. Upon expiration of the Evaluation
Period, unless terminated earlier by Sun, you agree to immediately
cease use of and destroy Software.  Either party may terminate this
Evaluation Agreement upon ten (10) days' written notice to the other
party. However, Sun may terminate this Evaluation Agreement
immediately should any Software become, or in Sun's opinion be likely
to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent, trade
secret or copyright. Sun may terminate this Evaluation Agreement
immediately should you materially breach any of its provisions or take
any action in derogation of Sun's rights to the Confidential
Information licensed to you. Upon termination or expiration of this
Evaluation Agreement, you will immediately cease use of and destroy
Software, any copies thereof and provide to Sun? a written statement
certifying that you have complied with the foregoing obligations.
Rights and obligations under this Evaluation Agreement which by their
nature should survive, will remain in effect after termination or
expiration hereof.

V. NO SUPPORT. Sun is under no obligation to support Software or to
provide upgrades or error corrections ("Software Updates") to the
Software. If Sun, at its sole option, supplies Software Updates to
you, the Software Updates will be considered part of Software, and
subject to the terms of this Agreement.

VI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Licensee acknowledges that the Software
may be experimental and that the Software may have defects or
deficiencies, which cannot or will not be corrected by Sun.  Licensee
will hold Sun harmless from any claims based on Licensee's use of the
Software for any purposes other than those of internal evaluation, and
from any claims that later versions or releases of any Software
furnished to Licensee are incompatible with the Software provided to
Licensee under this Agreement.

VII. NO SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS. The Supplemental Terms following the BCL
