BSD License

The PostgreSQL JDBC driver is distributed under the BSD license, same as the server. The simplest explanation of the licensing terms is that you can do whatever you want with the product and source code as long as you don't claim you wrote it or sue us. You should give it a read though, it's only half a page.

Jar: mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar
Licence: GPL (FLOSS Exception)
MySQL FLOSS License Exception

The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source
Software-only Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the
"FLOSS Exception").

Version 0.6, 7 March 2007

Exception Intent

We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'')
applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS
licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (the ``GPL'').

Legal Terms and Conditions

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0
of the GPL:

 1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed
    entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a
    "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses
    listed below in section 1, as long as:
      a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the
         Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the
         Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,
         and which can reasonably be considered independent and
         separate works in themselves,
      b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
         are not derived from the Program, and which can
         reasonably be considered independent and separate works
         in themselves,
           i. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
              listed below, and
          ii. the object code or executable form of those sections
              are accompanied by the complete corresponding
              machine-readable source code for those sections on
              the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as
              the corresponding object code or executable forms of
              those sections, and
      c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a
         Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution
         medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be
         considered independent and separate works in themselves
         which are not derivatives of either the Program, a
         Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
    If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only
    be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and
    conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from
    MySQL AB.

    Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we
    require that any version follow the 2003 version of the Free
    Software Foundation's Free Software Definition
    (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of
    the Open Source Definition by the Open Source Initiative
    (http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php).

 3. Definitions

      a. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the
         meaning provided in the GPL.
      b. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright
         law.

 4. Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs
    that contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the
    Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS
    Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a
    Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work
    licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not
    available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS
    Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all
    respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may
    choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
    the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice
    from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has
    never been modified by you or any third party.

Appendix A. Qualified Libraries and Packages

The following is a non-exhaustive list of libraries and packages
which are covered by the FLOSS License Exception. Please note that
this appendix is provided merely as an additional service to
specific FLOSS projects wishing to simplify licensing information
for their users. Compliance with one of the licenses noted under
the "FLOSS license list" section remains a prerequisite.

Copyright (c) 2005 Sun Microsystems, Inc.

I. LICENSE GRANTS, TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS 1.0 General License Terms.
This Java Distribution License ("JDL") is between Sun Microsystems,
Inc. ("Sun") and You where "You" means the individual or legal entity
exercising rights under this JDL. "Technology" means the following as
provided under this JDL: (i) the source code and binary code from the
Reference Implementation ("RI") of the JavaTM Advanced Imaging version
1.1.x Specification (the "Specification") and related documentation,
all as revised or upgraded and made available hereunder; and (ii) the
associated technology compatibility kit ("TCK"). The TCK contains the
TCK documentation, user's guide ("TCK User's Guide"), test tools and
test suite associated with the Specification, as revised or upgraded
by Sun. The TCK is provided so that You may determine if Your
implementation is compliant with the Specification. "Modifications"
means any (i) change or addition to or derivative of the Technology;
or (ii) new source or object code implementing the Specification for
the Technology. "Commercial Use" means: (i) Your use of the RI and/or
Modifications as part of a Compatible Implementation within Your
business or organization, but only by Your employees or agents; and/or
(ii) any use or distribution, directly or indirectly by You of the RI
and/or Modifications as part of a Compatible Implementation to any
third party, alone or bundled with any other software or hardware, for
direct or indirect commercial or strategic gain or advantage. By Your
use or distribution of the Technology and Modifications, You agree to
the terms of this JDL. 2.0 License Grants, Restrictions and
Termination. 2.1 Commercial Use and Internal Deployment License
Grants. Subject to the terms of this JDL, Sun grants to You, to the
extent of Sun's licensable copyrights, patents and trade secrets in
the RI, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide and
royalty-free license to modify, compile, reproduce, distribute,
internally use and internally deploy code and related documentation
from the RI and/or Modifications for Commercial Use, but only as part
of Your own Compatible Implementation (as defined below), and only if
You make such distributions as follows: (i) Source Code. You can only
distribute source code for the RI and Modifications under all of the
following conditions: (a) You make such distribution under the terms
of this JDL; (b) without offering or imposing any different terms; (c)
to a receipient who has accepted the terms of this JDL; and (d) You
provide a copy of this JDL to each such receipient; (ii) Binary Code.
You can distribute binary code for the RI and Modifications but only
under license terms which (a) have been accepted by the receipient;
(b) are consistent, and not conflicting, with the terms of the JDL;
and (c) where such terms are no less protective of Sun than the terms
of this JDL. 2.2 TCK License Grant. Subject to the terms of this JDL,
Sun grants to You, to the extent of Sun's licensable copyrights,
patents and trade secrets in the TCK, a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, worldwide and royalty-free license to internally use
the TCK for the sole purpose of developing and testing Your Compatible
Implementations (as defined below). 2.2.1 TCK Master Support
Agreement. If you desire support for the TCK, You may execute a
separate TCK master support agreement with Sun. 2.2.2 TCK Use Terms.
Your TCK license grant hereunder is expressly conditioned upon your
continued adherance to the following restrictions: (i) You may not
sublicense or distribute the TCK to any third party except for any
specific TCK code files identified as redistributables in the TCK
User's Guide ("Redistributables"), but only: (a) as part of a TCK
Adaptor accompanying a Compatible Implementation (where a "TCK
Adaptor" means a program that effects interoperability between the TCK
and the Compatible Implementation); and (b) pursuant to a license
agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms of
the JDL; (ii) You may not create derivative works of the TCK nor of
any of its components except for the Redistributables in a TCK
Adaptor; (iii) You may not disassemble or decompile binary portions of
the TCK's test suites or test tools or otherwise attempt to derive the
source code from such binary portions; (iv) You may not develop other
test suites intended to validate compatibility with the Specification
to which the TCK licensed hereunder corresponds; (v) You may not use
the TCK to test a third party's product; (vi) You may not make
Commercial Use of code which implements any portion of the
Specification unless such code is included in a Compatible
Implementation; (vii) You may disclose Test Reports (where "Test
Reports" means those reports generated by the TCK which identify only
configuration information and the status of individual or aggregate
test executions) for an implementation which You are attempting to
certify in accordance with the terms of this JDL for the sole purpose
of making Your implementation a Compatible Implementation, but you may
not make any claims of comparative compatibility nor disclose any
other TCK testing information to any party. For example, You cannot
claim that Your implementation is "nearly compatible" or "98%
compatible." When You share Test Reports in any public forum,
including mailing lists, marketing material or press releases, and
Your implementation is not a Compatible Implementation, You must state
that Your implementation is "not compatible;" and (viii) You will
protect the TCK as confidential information of Sun and, except as
expressly authorized herein, You may not disclose the TCK to any third
party. This obligation of confidentiality with respect to the TCK will
survive any termination or expiration of this JDL. Java 3D/Java
Distribution Lic. 1 11 February 2005/jbn Sun Confidential and
Proprietary 2.3 Term and Termination. This JDL shall have an initial
term of three (3) years after your acceptance of this JDL and shall
thereafter automatically renew for additional one year terms unless
either party provides notice to the other party sixty (60) days prior
to an anniversary date. The license grants of this JDL, are expressly
conditioned upon Your not acting outside their scope, and Your
continued compliance with the material provisions of this JDL. All
license grants under this JDL will automatically and immediately be
revoked without notice if You fail to so comply. Upon termination or
expiration of this JDL, You must discontinue all use and distribution
of the Technology and any Compatible Implementation licensed under
this JDL. All sublicenses You have properly granted hereunder shall
survive termination or expiration of Your rights under the JDL.
Provisions which should, by their nature, remain in effect after
termination or expiration shall survive, including, without
limitation, the provisions of Article II (General Terms) and the TCK
confidentiality obligations under this JDL. 2.4 General License
Restrictions. Some portions of the Technology are provided with
notices and/or open source or other licenses from other parties which
govern the use of those portions. Your use or distribution of
encryption technology contained within the Technlogy is subject to all
applicable governmental regulations of the United States of America
and the country where the Technology is deployed. You agree to comply
with the U.S. export controls and trade laws of other countries that
apply to the Technology and Compatible Implementations. You
acknowledge that the Technology is not designed, licensed or intended
for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any
nuclear facility. Other than the rights granted herein, Sun retains
all rights, title, and interest in the Technlogy. 3.0 Compatibility
and Use of the TCK. 3.1 Compatible Implementation TCK Requirements.
Your use of the RI and/or Modifications as part of an implementation
of the Specification is a "Compatible Implementation" if the
implementation meets the following requirements: 3.1.1 A Compatible
Implementation must comply with the full Specification, including all
its required interfaces and functionality; 3.1.2 A Compatible
Implementation must either: (i) pass the most current compatibility
requirements (as defined by the TCK User's Guide) which were made
available by Sun one hundred twenty (120) days before first commercial
shipment ("FCS") of each version of the Compatible Implementation (eg.
if Your FCS was December 31, 2003, You must have passed the most
current version of the TCK as of September 2, 2003); or (ii) at Your
option, pass all the compatibility requirements of a newer version of
the TCK and its associated TCK User's Guide; 3.1.3 A Compatible
Implementation may not modify the functional behavior of the "Java
Classes" which means the specific class libraries associated with the
Technology; and 3.1.4 A Compatible Implementation may not modify,
subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, nor
include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces,
fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those
required and/or authorized by the Specification. "Licensor Name Space"
means the public class or interface declarations whose names begin
with "java", "javax", "com.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent
naming convention adopted by Sun through the Java Community Process,
or any recognized successors or replacements thereof. 3.2
Self-Certification for Compatibility. You shall self-certify that Your
Compatible Implementation passes the applicable TCK as set forth
above, if and when Your Compatible Implementation in fact does so,
provided that: 3.2.1 If Sun policy (as communicated to You by Sun)
also requires verification of compatibility for Your Compatible
Implementation then You shall, prior to the FCS of the Compatible
Implementation, submit verification of compatibility to Sun or to an
independent test facility designated by Sun. If such verification is
by an independent test facility, then the reasonable costs of such
activity (including any applicable fees) shall be at Your expense. Sun
may publish or otherwise disclose Your test results. 3.2.2 Upon thirty
(30) days written notice by Sun, and no more than two (2) times per
calendar year, You shall permit Sun or its authorized representative
to inspect and test any Compatible Implementation which has been
self-certified per this subsection 3.2 to ensure that such Compatible
Implementation meets the compatibility and other requirements for a
Compatible Implementation as set forth herein. The reasonable costs of
such inspection shall be at Sun's expense; provided, however, that You
shall reimburse Sun for such costs if the inspection reveals that the
Compatible Implementation does not meet such requirements and these
deficiencies are not cured within thirty (30) days. 4.0 Fees and
Royalties. There are no fees or royalites associated with the license
grants for the Technology licensed under this JDL.

II. GENERAL TERMS

Sun's sole discretion, upon any action initiated by You alleging that
the use or distribution of the Technology and/or Modifications by Sun,
or any other licensee of the Technology and/or Modifications,
infringes a patent owned or controlled by You. In addition, if any
portion of, or functionality implemented by, the Technology becomes
the subject of a claim or threatened claim of infringement ("Affected
Materials"), Sun may, at its sole option, (i) attempt to procure the
rights necessary for You to continue using the Affected Materials,
(ii) modify the Affected Materials so that they are no longer
infringing, or (iii) immediately suspend Your rights to use and
distribute the Affected Materials under this JDL by providing notice
