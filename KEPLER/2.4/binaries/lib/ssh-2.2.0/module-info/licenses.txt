1.  Redistributions of this Software, with or without modification,
    must reproduce the GTPL in: (1) the Software, or (2) the Documentation
    or some other similar material which is provided with the Software
    (if any).

2.  The Documentation, alone or if included with a redistribution of
    the Software, must include the following notice: "This

    owner from info@globus.org.

4.  To the extent that patent claims licensable by the University of

    a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under such patent
    claims, with the rights to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and

    If you or any subsequent transferee (a "Recipient") institutes patent
    litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
